# AO-Champion-Analysis

This report outlines the key information and trends found in Australian Open Tennis championships matches.
We analyse the relevant data in the 2024-Spring-Ass2-v15.xlsx dataset which contains matches dating back to
1905. By effectively graphing the data, we outline key findings and trends for both the game and key
individual players. This includes Australia’s dominance and Maragaret Court’s unmatched 11 championships.
